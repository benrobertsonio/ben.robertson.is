# Freedom

Today I signed up for a trial of [Freedom](https://freedom.to). When motivation gets low, I find it's really easy to mindlessly scroll and check notifications. Twitter, slack and email are my biggest ones. Yesterday was pretty unproductive due to my sleepiness, lack of motivation, and easily available notification catnip. We'll see if Freedom can get me through slumps like that üôè. So far, one session in, it was really helpful.

We waited to eat dinner until the kids were in bed. Then we (Ruth, Robyn, me) ate out on the deck, had some drinks, and finished the cheesecake from Easter. It was a cool evening with a nice breeze and we saw the starts come out. It was relaxing to have a meal without the kids and just be able to sit and talk and laugh a bit.
