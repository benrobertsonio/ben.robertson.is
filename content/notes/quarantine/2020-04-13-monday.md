# Monday 

Today...

Woke up around 7:15 to Isaac ready to get up. Was pretty groggy. We all ate breakfast together which was nice...and it was a good breakfast too since we had left overs from yesterday (bacon, quiche, cinnamon rolls).

Dorothy actually slept pretty well but there was also a bad storm in the night that woke us up. Surprisingly, I feel waaaaay more tired today than I did the day before.

Normal work day, but a little less productive than normal.

Testing some builds stuff, and the updated firebase support.

And created this site to test it!

After dinner and getting the kids to bed, we finished Rise of Skywalker. Overall I was disappointed with it - seemed like a story/plot driven by committee, rather than a single narrative. Too many characters, too many loose ends to tie up. But glad to have finally seen it.

Before bed, I read this post on [Marketing Yourself](https://www.swyx.io/writing/marketing-yourself) which is really great. I had thought and done some of this stuff in the past. With my new role at Gatsby though, I feel like I've changed directions and my personal brand at [benrobertson.io](https://benrobertson.io) doesn't exactly line up with that change of direction. And honestly, I'm not even sure what direction I'm going in now!
