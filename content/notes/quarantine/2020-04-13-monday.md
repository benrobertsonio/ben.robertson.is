# Monday 

Today...

Woke up around 7:15 to Isaac ready to get up. Was pretty groggy. We all ate breakfast together which was nice...and it was a good breakfast too since we had left overs from yesterday (bacon, quiche, cinnamon rolls).

Dorothy actually slept pretty well but there was also a bad storm in the night that woke us up. Surprisingly, I feel waaaaay more tired today than I did the day before.

Normal work day, but a little less productive than normal.

Testing some builds stuff, and the updated firebase support.

And created this site to test it!
