# Easter

We were awake every hour of the night. Dorothy managed to wake up every hour, and so did we :)

Exhausting night, and we were all tired in the morning, except for Isaac. Nevertheless, the morning was fun. We had a nice brunch with quiche, bacon, cinnamon rolls, and mimosas (just juice for kids).

Isaac chugged his juice, asked for more (nope!), ate a cinnamon roll, and then ran to his play room. "I probably...clean my toy room" and amazingly, he did. He picked up every toy off the ground until it was spotless.

We went on a walk in the neighborhood before it was supposed to rain. Surprise - it rained on us. Me, Ruth, and Isaac sang "Keep on the Sunny Side" at the top of our lungs while Dorothy screamed in the stroller and we ran all the way home under our rainbow umbrella.

For dinner, I grilled steaks (and chicken) in the cold pouring rain. Ruth made cauliflower mashed "potatoes", and asparagus. Robyn made a salad. We ate around 4:45. Then my family came over with cheesecake.

We zoomed with some friends and then crashed around 10pm.

Woke up at midnight with Dorothy.

Tornado warning came around 4am - I pretty much slept through it ðŸ˜¬.
